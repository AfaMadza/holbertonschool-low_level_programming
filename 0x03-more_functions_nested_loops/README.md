# More Functions and Nested Loops
At the end of this project, students should be able to:

* Discuss nested loops and explain how to use them
* Create functions, and use them in different C files
* Explain the difference between declaring a function and defining a function
* Explain prototypes and scope of variables
* Understand: ``gcc`` and the compilation flags: ``-Wall``, ``-Werror``, ``-pedantic``, ``-Wextra``
* Understand why to use header files and how to include them with ``#include``
